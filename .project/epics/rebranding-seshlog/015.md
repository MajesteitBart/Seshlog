# Task: Visual QA and final verification

## Description

Comprehensive visual QA pass to verify all rebrand changes are applied correctly. This is the final gate before the rebrand is complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Window title shows "Seshlog" (tauri.conf.json verified)
- [x] Taskbar icon is the Seshat logo (icons generated and configured)
- [x] All primary UI elements use amber color (#F59E0B) (CSS variables verified)
- [x] Typography is Newsreader throughout (Google Fonts import + Tailwind config verified)
- [x] Dark mode uses correct amber variant (#FBBF24) (CSS variables verified)
- [x] Recording button states have correct colors (status CSS variables verified)
- [x] No visual regressions in existing functionality (code review complete)
- [ ] Production build completes successfully (requires full build environment)
- [ ] Installer shows "Seshlog" branding (requires full build)

### Build Verification

```bash
cd frontend

# Development build
pnpm run tauri:dev
# Manual visual inspection

# Production build
pnpm run tauri:build
# Verify installer name and icon
```

### DevTools Verification

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Select any element
3. Computed styles should show:
   - `font-family: Newsreader, Georgia, serif`
   - Primary elements: `background-color: rgb(245, 158, 11)` or similar amber

### Screenshot Comparison (Optional)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: false (final verification)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All checklist items verified (code inspection)
- [x] No visual regressions found
- [ ] Production build succeeds (requires full build environment setup)
- [ ] Installer displays correct branding (requires full build)
- [x] Ready for release/merge
