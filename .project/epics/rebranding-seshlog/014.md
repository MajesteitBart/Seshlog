# Task: Update documentation for Seshlog rebrand

## Description

Update all project documentation to reflect the Seshlog branding. This ensures contributors and users see the correct app name throughout.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] README.md introduces the app as "Seshlog"
- [x] CLAUDE.md project overview updated
- [x] Any other markdown files with app name updated
- [x] Documentation accurately describes the app
- [x] No references to "Meeting Companion" or "Meetily" remain

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify

**1. `README.md`:**
- Update title/header to "Seshlog"
- Update description
- Keep technical details accurate

**2. `CLAUDE.md`:**
- Update "Project Overview" section
- Change "Meeting Companion" → "Seshlog"
- Update any workflow descriptions that reference the app name
- Keep technical implementation details (they're still accurate)

### Search for References
```bash
# Find all markdown files with old names
grep -r "Meeting Companion" *.md .project/
grep -r "Meetily" *.md .project/
```

### Key Sections to Update in CLAUDE.md

1. **Project Overview** (line ~5-10):
   - "Meeting Companion is a desktop application..." → "Seshlog is a desktop application..."

2. **Key Differences from Meetily** table:
   - Keep this as historical context, but clarify Seshlog is the new name

3. **UI Layout (MVP)** diagram:
   - Update window title in ASCII art

4. Any other casual references

### Documentation Style
- Use "Seshlog" for the app name (capital S)
- Keep the description: "Desktop app for meeting transcription with Obsidian integration"
- Mention the origin story if relevant: "Seshlog (session log + Seshat, Egyptian goddess of writing)"

## Dependencies

- [ ] None (can start immediately)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (independent of other tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [x] README.md updated with Seshlog branding
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated throughout
- [x] grep finds no remaining old name references in core docs
- [x] Documentation reads naturally with new name
- [x] No broken links or references

## Completion Notes

**Completed:** 2026-01-29T10:39:03Z

### Changes Made

**README.md:**
- Complete rewrite for Seshlog branding
- Updated header with Seshlog icon
- Focused on Obsidian integration workflow
- Simplified installation instructions
- Added Obsidian file format documentation
- Added acknowledgment of Meetily foundation

**CLAUDE.md:**
- Replaced all "Meeting Companion" references with "Seshlog"
- Updated UI Layout diagram header
- Preserved technical implementation details

### Notes
- Project management files (PRDs, epics) retain historical "Meeting Companion" references for context
- Internal code files (.project/context/) not updated (would require separate task)
